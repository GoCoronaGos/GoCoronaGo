# GoCoronaGo
"Flatten the Curve, Then Recover the Economy" Virtual Hackathon

The goal of the hackathon will be to collect and curate worldwide open data and to refine, transform, and link that data to provide a visualization regarding the impact of COVID-19.

We will look at two themes:

overall understanding of the efforts to flatten the curve
economic recovery especially for Alberta and Canada
This is about providing a better understanding of the story, through data.
